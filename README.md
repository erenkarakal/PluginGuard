## Features
### Command Hider
PluginGuard hides all the commands from the player except the ones in the config.
This is unfortunetly not possible for proxy commands.
If a player executes a command that they can't see, it will return "Unknown Command".

### Cheat Detection
PluginGuard can detect cheaters who are trying to see your plugins. You can return a fake list, show no plugins or run a console command on them.
This check is 100% accurate.
